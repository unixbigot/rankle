Options (use --help) help can be used to control which toots are inspected and what cutoffs
to use for follower count etc.

```
‚ùØ ./rankle.py --help
usage: rankle.py [-h] [-c [COUNT]] [-v] [--base [BASE]] [--tagged TAGGED] [--retoots RETOOTS] [--top TOP] [--followers FOLLOWERS] [--token [TOKEN]]

Rank toots by popularity

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c [COUNT], --count [COUNT]
                        number of toots to examine
  -v, --verbose         include extra detail
  --base [BASE]         api base url
